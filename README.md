# Livingston_Arad-Code
This repository is to store the code for the FTC team made through the partnership between Livingston High School in Livingston, New Jersey and the new FTC team in Arad, Israel. This partnership is based on the principals of the Living Bridge and will hopefully last for a long time. This repository will have the code for each year's competition, as well as the CAD files and their evolutions, the website's source code, and any other files which would require overseas collaboration.
